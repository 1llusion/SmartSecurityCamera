# SmartSecurityCamera
Part of an ongoing "Smart Webcam" project.
Cuts out any parts of a video that does not have any humans visible.

In the same folder as this file create 3 sub-folders:
    -> humans   # Stores videos of detected humans
    -> frames   # Stores frames extracted from video
    -> models   # Stores pre-trained models. All should be set-up already, though
    -> temp     # Temporary folder for analysed images.
    
After running the code, please empty the frames and temp folder. This shall be automated in the future.
